# Windows-Terminal-settings
My Windows Terminal settings configuration.

## Requirements
+ Powershell core 7
+ A WSL (I use Ubuntu LTR 20.04)
+ Python 3.9
+ Vim 8.2

## Notes

Python icon is in the installation directory, Vim one should be added manually downloading it and pointing at it in the Windows Terminal setting file.
